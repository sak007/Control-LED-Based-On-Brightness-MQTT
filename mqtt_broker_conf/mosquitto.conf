# =================================================================
# General configuration
# =================================================================

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1
# and 2 messages.
max_inflight_messages 0

# For MQTT v5 clients, it is possible to have the server send a "server
# keepalive" value that will override the keepalive value set by the client.
# This is intended to be used as a mechanism to say that the server will
# disconnect the client earlier than it anticipated, and that the client should
# use the new keepalive value. The max_keepalive option allows you to specify
# that clients may only connect with keepalive less than or equal to this
# value, otherwise they will be sent a server keepalive telling them to use
# max_keepalive. This only applies to MQTT v5 clients. The default, and maximum
# value allowable, is 65535.
#
# Set to 0 to allow clients to set keepalive = 0, which means no keepalive
# checks are made and the client will never be disconnected by the broker if no
# messages are received. You should be very sure this is the behaviour that you
# want.
#
# For MQTT v3.1.1 and v3.1 clients, there is no mechanism to tell the client
# what keepalive value they should use. If an MQTT v3.1.1 or v3.1 client
# specifies a keepalive time greater than max_keepalive they will be sent a
# CONNACK message with the "identifier rejected" reason code, and disconnected.
#
max_keepalive 65535

# Set the maximum QoS supported. Clients publishing at a QoS higher than
# specified here will be disconnected.
max_qos 2

# =================================================================
# Listeners
# =================================================================

# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given,
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# Note that for a websockets listener it is not possible to bind to a host
# name.
#
# On systems that support Unix Domain Sockets, it is also possible
# to create a # Unix socket rather than opening a TCP socket. In
# this case, the port number should be set to 0 and a unix socket
# path must be provided, e.g.
# listener 0 /tmp/mosquitto.sock
#
# listener port-number [ip address/host name/unix socket path]
listener 1883

# =================================================================
# Persistence
# =================================================================

# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
# This saves information about all messages, including
# subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained
# messages.
# retained_persistence is a synonym for this option.
persistence false

# =================================================================
# Security
# =================================================================

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to
# false then a password file should be created (see the
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access.
#
# Defaults to false, unless there are no listeners defined in the configuration
# file, in which case it is set to true, but connections are only allowed from
# the local machine.
allow_anonymous false

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Default authentication and topic access control
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
# offers very little in the way of security.
#
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options. If a plugin is used as well as
# password_file, the plugin check will be made first.
